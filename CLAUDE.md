# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Captain is an open-source CLI tool written in Go that provides test automation utilities including:

- Flaky test detection and quarantine
- Automatic retry of failed tests
- Test file partitioning for parallel execution
- Comprehensive test failure summaries

The tool integrates with various CI platforms and supports multiple test frameworks across different languages.

## Common Commands

### Building

```bash
# Build the Captain CLI binary
go run ./tools/mage build

# Clean build artifacts
go run ./tools/mage clean
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration)
go run ./tools/mage test

# Run unit tests only
go run ./tools/mage unittest

# Run integration tests only
go run ./tools/mage integrationtest

# Run tests with report generation
REPORT=true go run ./tools/mage test

# Update snapshot tests
UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=true go run ./tools/mage test
```

### Linting

```bash
# Run linter
go run ./tools/mage lint

# Run linter and fix issues
go run ./tools/mage lintfix
```

### Development

```bash
# Run all build tasks (clean, build, test, lint)
go run ./tools/mage all

# View available mage targets
go run ./tools/mage -l
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **cmd/captain**: Main CLI entry point and command configuration
- **internal/cli**: Core business logic for CLI commands (run, parse, partition, etc.)
- **internal/parsing**: Test result parsers for various frameworks (Jest, RSpec, Pytest, etc.)
- **internal/backend**: Local and remote backend implementations for test data storage
- **internal/providers**: CI provider integrations (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, BuildKite, etc.)
- **internal/targetedretries**: Framework-specific retry command generation
- **internal/testingschema/v1**: Internal test results schema and data structures

### Key Flows

1. **Test Execution**: CLI parses configuration → runs test command → parses results → uploads/reports
2. **Partitioning**: Reads test files → distributes across partitions → generates partition-specific commands
3. **Retries**: Analyzes failed tests → generates retry commands using framework-specific templates
4. **Parsing**: Reads test output files → converts to internal schema → processes for reporting

### Configuration

Configuration is handled through:

- Command-line flags
- Environment variables (prefixed with `CAPTAIN_`)
- YAML configuration files
- CI provider auto-detection

The main configuration struct is `RunConfig` in `internal/cli/config.go`.

## Testing Notes

- Uses Ginkgo as the primary test framework
- Snapshot testing with cupaloy for output validation
- Integration tests in `/test` directory with fixtures
- CI environment simulation via sourcing test env files (e.g., `test/.env.github.actions`)
- Test fixtures include examples for all supported test frameworks

## Development Environment

- No external dependencies required beyond Go
- Uses Mage for build automation instead of Make
- Supports debugging with `--debug` and `--insecure` flags
- Can route API traffic via `CAPTAIN_HOST` environment variable

Title: Senior Engineer Task Execution Rule

Applies to: All Tasks

Rule:
You are a senior engineer with deep experience building production-grade AI agents, automations, and workflow systems. Every task you execute must follow this procedure without exception:

1.Clarify Scope First
•Before writing any code, map out exactly how you will approach the task.
•Confirm your interpretation of the objective.
•Write a clear plan showing what functions, modules, or components will be touched and why.
•Do not begin implementation until this is done and reasoned through.

2.Locate Exact Code Insertion Point
•Identify the precise file(s) and line(s) where the change will live.
•Never make sweeping edits across unrelated files.
•If multiple files are needed, justify each inclusion explicitly.
•Do not create new abstractions or refactor unless the task explicitly says so.

3.Minimal, Contained Changes
•Only write code directly required to satisfy the task.
•Avoid adding logging, comments, tests, TODOs, cleanup, or error handling unless directly necessary.
•No speculative changes or “while we’re here” edits.
•All logic should be isolated to not break existing flows.

4.Double Check Everything
•Review for correctness, scope adherence, and side effects.
•Ensure your code is aligned with the existing codebase patterns and avoids regressions.
•Explicitly verify whether anything downstream will be impacted.

5.Deliver Clearly
•Summarize what was changed and why.
•List every file modified and what was done in each.
•If there are any assumptions or risks, flag them for review.

Reminder: You are not a co-pilot, assistant, or brainstorm partner. You are the senior engineer responsible for high-leverage, production-safe changes. Do not improvise. Do not over-engineer. Do not deviate
